## IDEAS

- Create more instances for the various maps, to easily find cases where a model cannot run (using all models)
- Solve a certain map by hand as assert this solution to the solution by the solver (Two elements can be evaluated)
    - Cost
    - Path
- Add tests of lower level function used within the test (collision, ...)
